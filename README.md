## How to embed the widget

1. Copy the code below and paste it to your HTML page between the `<body>...</body>` tags, where:

* `[YOUR VALIDATOR'S VOTE KEY]` is the vote key of your validator node.
* `[THEME]` is the Widget's theme: replace with `light` for a light theme, replace with `dark` for a dark one.

```html
<iframe id="staking-kiwi-widget-0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="" style="position: static; visibility: visible; width: 472px; height: 302px" title="Staking Kiwi widget" src="https://widget.staking.kiwi/?validator=[YOUR VALIDATOR'S VOTE KEY]&theme=[THEME]" ></iframe>
```

2. Done! Delegators can now stake to your validator directly on your website.
