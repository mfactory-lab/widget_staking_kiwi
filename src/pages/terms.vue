      <p><strong>3. Staking Services</strong></p>

      <p>
        The term &ldquo;staking&rdquo; refers to depositing digital assets in one or several nodes
        of a blockchain network, which enables such nodes to participate in the functioning of said
        network. Users who &ldquo;stake&rdquo; their assets receive rewards from the network during
        the period in which their assets are staked in the described fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Service facilitates staking SOL cryptocurrency to validators of the Solana network. A
        smart strategy is used aiming to maximize both the user&rsquo;s rewards and the
        network&rsquo;s performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a confirmation of the user&rsquo;s ownership of their stake, they receive jSOL tokens
        which can be used in various DeFi (decentralized finance) activities and, ultimately, to
        withdraw the deposited stake.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Service does not store your digital assets nor your keys, and does not in any way
        provide a custodian service.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using this service, you acknowledge that the Service can neither guarantee nor influence
        the rewards issued by the Solana network, as well as the future price of your digital
        assets. We do not accept any responsibility for the dynamics of SOL price, delegation and/or
        validation rewards, and the future of cryptocurrency in general. Please smile if you are
        still reading.
      </p>

      <p><strong>4. Disclaimer of Liability</strong></p>

      <p>
        We do not accept any responsibility for the legality of the user&rsquo;s actions, their
        obligations of reporting and/or payments to any legal, fiscal, or other authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also do not accept any responsibility for any losses and/or damages whatsoever including,
        without limitation, direct, indirect, special or consequential loss or damage and/or loss of
        profits, business revenue, goodwill or anticipated savings arising out of access to or use
        of or reliance on any information posted on the Service&rsquo;s web site or any hypertext or
        hyperlink to a web site or any information contained on or accessed through such web site.

        liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
      </p>
      <p>

        termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers,
        indemnity and limitations of liability.
